<h4>No, I mean why another white male author.</h4>
<p>Erm, here's the thing:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust">Marcel Proust</a> is one of the better ones</li>
<li>Have you ever been in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_Lost_Time">The Search of Lost Time</a> after messing around with setting up the site rather than write the three blog posts for which you were doing it? Yeah, me too</li>
<li>It's a riff on <a href="https://parceljs.org/">Parcel</a>, the bundler. But, like, for Markdown</li>
<li>There are only so many npm package names available</li>
<li>I have a good friend named Marcel. (He's indifferent to the association)</li>
<li>How many bad puns do I have to throw at the question?</li>
</ol>
