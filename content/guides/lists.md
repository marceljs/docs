title: Working with lists

Marcel can build lists from your custom taxonomies.

By default, list pages are created for the following aspects of a post:

* its `section`
* its `tags`

You can create content files for lists by creating `content/taxonomy/index.md` (for the entire taxonomy) or `content/taxonomy/term/index.md` for individual terms.

## Custom taxonomies

To create lists for additional taxonomies, add it in your `marcel.config.js`
