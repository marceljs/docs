_Note: nobody has asked these questions yet, but one can only assume._

#### There are at least as many static site generators as there are famous white male authors. Why another one?

Yes, there are more than half a dozen other static site generators. But this one is different.

#### No, I mean why another white male author.

Erm, here's the thing:

1. [Marcel Proust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust) is one of the better ones
2. Have you ever been in [The Search of Lost Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_Lost_Time) after messing around with setting up the site rather than write the three blog posts for which you were doing it? Yeah, me too
3. It's a riff on [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), the bundler. But, like, for Markdown
4. There are only so many npm package names available
5. I have a good friend named Marcel. (He's indifferent to the association)
6. How many bad puns do I have to throw at the question?

#### Right. And how is it different?
